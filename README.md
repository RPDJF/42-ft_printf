# ðŸš€ 42 ft_printf ðŸš€

Hey code wizards! This GitHub haven is where I've tucked away the 42 ft_printf project, a gem from the 42 course. Dive into my coding saga, but remember, face the challenges solo before delving into my solutions, capisce?

## What's ft_printf, Anyway?

ft_printf is a code odyssey that'll have you mastering the art of formatting output. It's like wielding a magic wand over your print statements! âœ¨

## Compile-it! ðŸ’»

Here's the magic chant to summon your ft_printf masterpiece:

- `make`: Standard ritual. Compile the code, and you're good to go!
- `make clean`: Sweep away the traces of your enchantment. A tidy workspace is a powerful workspace.
- `make fclean`: Need a clean slate? This wipes out all enchantments, leaving nothing behind.
- `make debug`: Unleash the debug sorcery with lldb. Warning: It leaves behind extra mystical artifacts not handled by `make fclean`.

Navigate this enchanted realm with these commands, and may your ft_printf journey be legendary! ðŸŒŸðŸ”®

## Cloning the Repository
To embark on this coding adventure, use the command:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:RPDJF/42-ft_printf.git
